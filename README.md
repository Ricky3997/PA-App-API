# Project Access App API

### Welcome

This repository is for the backend-end code of the Project Access App

### First time after cloning repository

First create a file called **.env** in the root of the folder and add:

`UI_URL=http://localhost:5000`

`NODE_ENV=development`

`MONGODB_URI=***`

`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***`

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***`

`SENDGRID_API_KEY=***`

Ask a member of the team for the values of _***_

Second install dependencies by running `npm install`

### Developing

To start developing run `node server.js` and you can then develop and ping the API at http://localhost:5000

To use the API in conjunction with the front-end, see https://github.com/Ricky3997/PA-App-API for that
